delete *.max file from CPUCode/results and RunRules/maxfiles.
go to CPUCode/Results (by clicking on SourceCode button) and delete *.max file and then go to the RunRules/Simulation/maxfiles and delete *.max file as well.

most importantly to check any result run freshly each time.

make changes in local code then run the updated on webIDE, otherwise it will be fucked up.
